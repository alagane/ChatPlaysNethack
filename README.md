# ChatPlaysNethack
Remember Twitch plays Pokémon? This time it's not Pokémon...

## How to?
It is a node project so:  
Clone the repository and cd into it  
Install dependencies with `yarn install`  
Run the bot with `node index.js`  
Use the command `!nethackhere` on the channel you want the bot to listen (you have to do it again if the bot is restarted)  
Just send input message in the channel, the latest input will be shown on the welcome message  
Spectate the game on nao, maybe this could bo improved one day...

## Todo
[X] Check character input (only ASCII characters)  
[X] Get input from Discord  
[ ] Use Ctrl and keys (kick doors with Ctrl+d)
